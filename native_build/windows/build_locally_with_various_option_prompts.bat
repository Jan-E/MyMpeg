ECHO Welcome to this FFmpeg compile script.
ECHO This process will first install a local copy of Cygwin to a new directory "ffmpeg_local_builds".
ECHO Then it will prompt you for some options like 32 bit vs. 64 bit, free vs. non free dependencies.
ECHO It will then build the GCC cross compiler, followed by FFmpeg dependencies and FFmpeg itself.
ECHO There are also even *more* option available than what you'll be prompted for.
ECHO If you want more advanced options after the first pass, it will give instructions when done
ECHO on how to run it again with more advanced options.
